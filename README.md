# go-tl-parser
Generates JSON or Go structs/methods of a Telegram .tl file 

## Usage
Install by running:
```bash
$ go get github.com/Arman92/go-tl-parser
```

Run by:
```bash
$ go-tl-parser file=./schema.tl dir=./tdlib package=tdlib structs-file=types.go methods-file=methods.go
```

This work is used in [Telegram Tdlib go binding](https://github.com/Arman92/go-tdlib) project, used to generate types and functions from .tl schema file, so you may want to change the code to meet your needs.

Files under tdlib folder are autogenerated (except tdjson.go which is only there for error-free compliation)

Credits  for basic c-bindings goes to [go-tdjson](https://github.com/L11R/go-tdjson)
